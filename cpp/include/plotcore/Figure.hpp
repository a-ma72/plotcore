// A whole plot: the lines, the view onto them, what the reader has chosen, and
// the picture all of that makes.
//
// What the viewer spreads across DatasetPlot, PlotSurface.qml, PlotFrame.qml
// and PlotItem, in one object a host can drive without knowing any of them.
// The host does three things and nothing else: it hands over the pane's size
// and how to measure text, it forwards the pointer and the wheel, and it
// paints the Scene that comes back -- the lines, and the marks to paint
// around them in order, in pane pixels with y down. Every decision between
// those is plotcore's, so a plot drawn from Qt, from Python and from Rust is
// the same plot: the same ticks at the same places, the same gestures moving
// the same windows, the same line in the same colour (golden/ holds the three
// to one another).
//
// The viewer's rules hold here as they do there, because the arithmetic is the
// viewer's -- Ticks.hpp and Camera.hpp are PlotFrame's and PlotSurface's,
// held to them by tst_plotcore_parity.qml. Three things are this file's own,
// all of them from #30, all of them about a line rather than the axes:
//
// - **A line may be moved and scaled on its axis** (LineSettings::scale and
//   shift): its window is the common window's share of a window of its own,
//   so one gesture still moves every line and a moved line stays moved.
// - **Lines may be stacked**, each in an equal band of the pane: the same
//   arithmetic, with the scale and shift that put each line's own extent in
//   its band.
// - **A line may carry a time of its own** (Plot::setLineTime), against the
//   one x axis every line shares.
//
// A line on an axis of its own, or stacked, is numbered beside the pane in
// its colour, as the viewer draws a separate axis -- and, as there, only while
// a second line is drawn. A line that is only moved or scaled is not: it is a
// reading in the common axis's units, the crosshair reads it in its own, and
// an axis appearing beside the pane on the first pixel of a drag would widen
// the gutter and move every x under the pointer that is dragging.
