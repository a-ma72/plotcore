// What a figure asks of the lines it draws, and nothing more.
//
// A Figure draws the lines of its own Plot unless it is handed a source of
// the host's. The viewer is the host that needs one: its lines are read out
// of a file on a thread of their own, a run at a time, and held under a
// budget shared between every plot in the window -- none of which a Figure
// should know about, and all of which ends in the same two answers a Plot
// gives: the line as it is drawn now, and the axis it is drawn against.
//
// So the questions are exactly the ones a Figure asks of its Plot, and a
// source answers them for whatever it holds. Two of them are not questions
// but news: the window the reader is looking at (setView, setPaneColumns),
// which is what lets a source decide what is worth folding or reading, and
// where a zoom is heading (focus), which is what lets it read that way before
// the reader gets there. A source that holds every line whole, as a Plot
// does, can take the news and do nothing with it.
//
// Lines are numbered from zero in the order they are drawn. A source need not
// hand over every line it has -- the viewer's Plot tab draws the first
// sixty-four rows of ten thousand -- so a line also says which *series* it
// is: the number the palette colours it by and the legend names it by, which
// does not move when a line before it is left out. See series().
