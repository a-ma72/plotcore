//
// Two things happen here and the order of them is the whole feature. The
// focus is pushed *first*, with the magnification the move amounts to, so
// that the closer look the model reads is read towards the region and
// goes out in the same turn rather than after the settle -- a stated
// region is not a gesture that might carry on, it is a reader who has
// already said where they are going. Then the window moves, and the
// bindings under it push the range.
//
// A band under a few pixels in either direction is a slip rather than a
// request: a two-pixel-tall window is a magnification of several hundred
// on an axis the reader never meant to touch, and the way out of it would
// be a reset. Refused whole rather than clamped to one axis, because
// which axis was meant is not something this can know.
//
// The band's top edge is the axis's larger value -- see dataYAt -- and
// its right edge too; on a flipped pane those are x's and y's the
// other way round, which dataXAt and dataYAt know.
//
// The middle of the band and the magnification it amounts to, both
// measured the way the axis measures: on a logarithmic one the middle
// of the band is the geometric mean of its ends, and a band a decade
// wide on a pane of six is six times in however many units that
// decade holds. Taken the linear way, a band over the first decades of
// a wide axis sent the read to the far end of it.
