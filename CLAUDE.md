# plotcore — working notes for Claude

The plot H5Scope draws, as a library: C++20 with no dependencies, a C
interface over it, and Python and Rust libraries over that. One directory per
language, each holding its library, its tests and a demo that walks every
feature. GPL-3.0-only.

"The viewer" everywhere in this repository is
[H5Scope](https://github.com/jonassattler/H5Scope), which pins this repository
as a git submodule at `plotcore/` and is where the library came from. The
history before 2026-10-18 is H5Scope's, filtered down to these files, and a
`jonassattler/H5Scope#N` in an old commit message is that repository's pull
request.

The code is heavily commented on purpose — most files open with an argument
for why they are the way they are, usually naming the failure that motivated
them. Read those headers before changing the code under them; they are the
design record. `Projection.hpp`, `Levels.hpp` and `Pyramid.hpp` above all.

## Build and test

```sh
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release     # no Qt, no Python, no Rust
cmake --build build --parallel
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

- `-DPLOTCORE_WITH_QT=ON -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=<qt>` adds the widget and the Qt
  demo, whose `--self-test` is the `plotcore_qt_demo` ctest test; run it
  with `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen`.
- **Python:** `pip install ./python` builds the wheel (scikit-build-core, from
  the CMake project one directory up), then `pytest python/tests` from
  *outside* the source tree, so that what is imported is what was installed.
  Against a C library built by hand: `PLOTCORE_LIBRARY=build/libplotcore_c.so`.
- **Rust:** in `rust/`, `cargo fmt --all --check`,
  `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --locked -- -D warnings`,
  `cargo test --workspace --locked`. CI runs exactly those three.
- **Demo packages:** `packaging/appimage/{qt,egui,pyqt6}-demo.sh` build one
  AppImage each and `verify.sh` checks one. They run anywhere, but only hold
  the RHEL 8 floor when run inside manylinux_2_28, which is what
  `in-container.sh` is for. Off a floor-sized machine, `verify.sh` fails on the
  floor and nothing else. `packaging/windows/{qt,egui,pyqt6}-demo.ps1` build
  one Windows folder each and `verify.ps1` checks one; they need Windows.

CI is `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: C++ and C, the Qt widget, Python and Rust,
each built and tested on Linux and Windows; then every demo packaged for both,
one artefact per demo per platform. It builds, tests and uploads artefacts;
it publishes nothing.

## Releasing

A tag `v<version>` is a release, and `.github/workflows/release.yml` is all of
it: it runs `ci.yml` at the tagged commit, then publishes what that built as a
GitHub release — the demos (the Windows folders zipped) and both wheels, with
a `SHA256SUMS`. **Nothing goes to PyPI or crates.io**, and nothing should
without the user asking for it: a version uploaded there cannot be taken
back.

- **The version** is in `CMakeLists.txt` (`project(plotcore VERSION …)`),
  `python/pyproject.toml`, and `rust/Cargo.toml` twice — `[workspace.package]`
  and the version beside each path in `[workspace.dependencies]`. The first
  job fails the release when the tag is not the first three; cargo fails the
  build when the fourth is not the first.
- **The notes** are the tag's annotation, from a file so that git's cleanup
  keeps the Markdown headings:
  `git tag -a --cleanup=whitespace -F notes.md v<version>`. A lightweight tag
  has none.
- **Python** is the release's wheels. There is no sdist: the wheel's CMake
  project is the whole repository, so one of `python/` could not build it.
  The wheel carries the licence in its `dist-info`, installed by the `SKBUILD`
  block of `CMakeLists.txt`.
- **Rust** is a git dependency on the tag
  (`cargo add plotcore --git … --tag v<version>`), which works because
  `plotcore-sys` reaches the C++ through `cpp/` and `c/` beside its manifest:
  symbolic links into the repository. `build.rs` reads through them, and from
  the repository directly where a checkout has the links as text files (Git
  for Windows' default). cargo follows them when it packages the crate, and
  `include` keeps the package to the core and the C interface, so the crates
  are publishable as they stand; CI's rust job runs `cargo package` on every
  commit to keep them so.

## Layout

One directory per language, each with its library, its tests and its demo.
The root `CMakeLists.txt` says what is built and installed; `cpp/` and `c/`
each define their own targets.

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `cpp/include/plotcore/`, `cpp/src/` | `plotcore::core`. The arithmetic: `Projection` (where a sample lands, gaps, the thinning, strokes as triangles), `Levels` (the fold and the policy over held runs), `Pyramid` (what every run is folded out of), `Budget` (what may be held), `Parallel` (the pool a large fold is spread over). The frame: `Format`, `Ticks`, `Camera`, `Palettes`. Then `LineSource` (what a figure asks of its lines), `Plot` (lines held, and one such source) and `Figure` (the whole plot a host drives). `cpp/src/Json.*` is private. |
| `cpp/tests/` | The Catch2 suites: `test_plotprojection`, `test_plotlevels`, `test_plotfigure`. |
| `cpp/qt/`, `cpp/qt-demo/` | `plotcore::qt`, a `QWidget` over a `Figure`, and the Qt demo. |
| `c/` | `plotcore.h`, `Figure` as C, built as `plotcore_c`, and `tests/test_capi.c`. |
| `python/` | The package (`src/plotcore`: `_native.py`, `figure.py`, `scene.py`, `qt.py`, `mpl.py`), its tests, and `pyqt6-demo/` with the demo's pinned `requirements.txt`. |
| `rust/` | `plotcore-sys`, `plotcore`, `plotcore-egui`, `egui-demo`, and `README.md`, which each crate also names as its own. |
| `golden/` | The script the C, Python and Rust tests all run, and its digest. |
| `packaging/` | The icon; `appimage/`, the demos for Linux; `windows/`, the demos for Windows. |

## plotcore and H5Scope

H5Scope builds this with `add_subdirectory(plotcore)` and links
`plotcore::core`; its own build also runs this repository's C++ tests, on its
RHEL 8 and MSVC toolchains. It uses the public headers and nothing else. Three
consequences:

- **A change here reaches the viewer when the viewer moves its pin.** That is
  an H5Scope pull request of its own (`git -C plotcore checkout <sha>`, commit
  the pointer), and it is where H5Scope's suite — `test_cost`,
  `test_customplot`, the parity suite — runs against the change. A change that
  needs the viewer to change with it lands here first, then in H5Scope with
  the pin.
- **`Format`, `Ticks`, `Camera` and `Palettes` are ports**, of H5Scope's
  `PlotFrame.qml`, `PlotSurface.qml` and `Theme.qml`, and H5Scope's
  `tests/qml/tst_plotcore_parity.qml` asks both the same questions and compares
  the answers exactly — values bit for bit, labels character for character,
  colours to a sixteen-bit step, JavaScript's own number formatting included.
  **A change to how an axis is numbered, ruled, zoomed or coloured is a change
  to both, or the parity suite fails when the pin moves.** The arguments for
  each rule are written over the QML, not repeated here.
- **The rules of the plot itself are written in H5Scope's CLAUDE.md** — the
  separate axes, the logarithmic axis and its edges, why a log x is folded per
  column, why an extreme is drawn at its element, what a zoom may read — and
  comments here point there. They are the viewer's behaviour, and this library
  is how the viewer has it.

## plotcore as a library

Four layers above the arithmetic, each the only place its question is
answered:

- **`Format`, `Ticks`, `Camera`, `Palettes`** — the ports above.
- **`Plot`** holds lines: copied in (the pyramid *is* the copy) or streamed
  through `PyramidBuilder`, at the base the budget affords, with an optional
  `LineReader` below it. Every picture is a fold of what is held; with no
  reader, a window finer than the base is drawn *at* the base rather than from
  the whole-line summary. It is one **`LineSource`**: what a `Figure` asks of
  its lines, and all it asks. A host that holds its lines its own way — the
  viewer, reading a file on a thread under a shared budget — hands the figure
  a source of its own (`Figure::setSource`); a line then also says which
  *series* it is, so a line keeps its colour when the host leaves one before it
  out. A figure asks each line what it spans once a frame, in `refresh()`:
  the viewer's Plot tab is ten thousand lines, and a question asked per line
  inside a loop over the lines is a hundred million.
- **`Figure`** is the whole plot a host drives: lines, settings, the camera,
  the gestures, and a `Scene` out in pane pixels with y down, flipping already
  applied: the lines, and the **marks** to paint under and over them in order —
  segments, boxes, circles and text, every colour, width and radius decided.
  A host measures text, forwards events and translates each mark into its
  toolkit's call; it decides nothing. The hosts used to draw the crosshair, the
  legend and the band themselves, and no two drew the same ones. A mark's
  *layer* (grid, frame, overlay) is for a host that draws some of it its own
  way: matplotlib draws its own frame and paints the overlay. Three things are this layer's own, all from
  jonassattler/H5Scope#30 and all about a line: **moved and scaled**
  (`LineSettings::scale`/`shift`, Alt-drag, Alt+Control+wheel, Control-click to
  put back), **stacked** in bands, and **a time per line**. A moved line stays
  in the common axis's extent and is numbered on it — an axis appearing beside
  the pane on the first pixel of a drag widened the gutter and moved every x
  under the pointer — and only a line on an axis of its own, or stacked, is
  numbered beside the pane. A scene is asked for with a `SceneRequest`: the
  forms of a line a host draws (`SceneOptions`), and whether it is a
  **picture** — the pane laid out again at another size, in the page's colours,
  with a crosshair pinned to a sample — which asks the lines for nothing and
  leaves the pane as it was. Every frame shares `kMaxVertices` between its
  lines (`maxColumnsFor`). `state()`/`restore()` write a view as JSON
  (`cpp/src/Json.*`), passing over what they cannot read as the viewer's saved
  views do.
- **`c/plotcore.h`** is `Figure` as C, built as one shared library
  (`plotcore_c`, exporting nothing else, its C++ runtime linked in). Settings
  are **named, not laid out** — `plotcore_set_bool(f, "xLog", 1)`, the names a
  saved view writes — so a new setting is a new name and not a new ABI.
  Nothing is borrowed across it, every failure is a status with
  `plotcore_last_error()` beside it, and `test_capi.c` is compiled as C.

`golden/` is what holds the three languages to one plot: a script of
settings and gestures, and the digest of every scene it asks for. `test_capi`
writes it (`--write`) and checks it; the Python and Rust tests check the same
file through their own bindings. **A changed line in `expected.txt` is a
changed picture**, so read the diff before committing one.

`cpp/qt/` is a `QWidget` over a `Figure`, and `cpp/qt-demo` walks every
feature on one window; `--self-test` walks them itself offscreen.

`python/` is ctypes over the C interface (`_native.py` declares the header line
for line and checks the ABI version before anything is called), so it links no
Python and one `py3-none` wheel per platform serves every version.
scikit-build-core builds it from the CMake project one directory up
(`cmake.source-dir = ".."`, the `SKBUILD` block in `CMakeLists.txt`), which is
also why the wheel is built from the repository and not from an sdist. Two
rules from the boundary: **a scene is copied out whole** into numpy, so nothing
Python holds points into the library; and **a reader's callback is kept by the
token the C side holds**, released when the C side says it has let go of it,
which is the only moment index bookkeeping in Python could not get wrong.
`plotcore.qt` is the PyQt6 widget, `plotcore.mpl` draws on matplotlib's own
axes from each run's data-unit values (`plotcore_scene_line_run_values`) with
the figure's gestures under them, and `python/pyqt6-demo/demo.py --self-test`
is the Qt demo's walk, run by `python/tests/test_qt.py`.

`rust/` is the workspace: `plotcore-sys` compiles `cpp/src/` and `c/` with the
`cc` crate and declares the header by hand (no libclang), and its test holds
every structure's size to what the C compiler that built the library makes of
it, because working them out by hand got two of them wrong; `plotcore` is the
safe wrapper, whose readers and text measure are boxed and handed to the C side
as contexts it gives back; `plotcore-egui` paints a scene as plotcore's
triangles or as feathered polylines and hands egui's raw input events over as
gestures; `egui-demo` walks every feature, and its `--self-test` drives egui
headless, so `cargo test` needs no display. `plotcore-sys` reaches `cpp/src/`
and `c/` through links beside its manifest, which is how a packaged crate
carries them (see "Releasing").

## The floor

What this repository ships for Linux starts on RHEL 8 — glibc 2.28 — as
H5Scope does, and it is held in three places:

- **`plotcore_c`** links its C++ runtime in (`-static-libstdc++`), because a
  wheel's library is loaded by whatever Python is on the machine. The wheel is
  built in manylinux_2_28 and repaired to that tag by auditwheel.
- **The AppImages** are built in manylinux_2_28 against libraries from
  AlmaLinux 8 and EPEL 8, on Qt 6.8 (6.11's binaries need glibc 2.34) and on
  PyQt6 6.9 (6.10's wheels are manylinux_2_34). They link the C++ runtime
  dynamically, as a prebuilt Qt does, and gcc-toolset is what makes that safe:
  it builds against the host's libstdc++ plus a static archive of what is
  newer. `check-floor.sh` reads every ELF file in each image back against
  glibc 2.28 and GCC 8's libstdc++, and `try-on-rhel8.sh` runs each on a stock
  AlmaLinux 8 under X11.
- **What an image leaves to the host is one list**, `HOST_LIBRARIES` in
  `packaging/appimage/common.sh` — glibc, the GL and driver stack, core X11 and
  the Wayland client, fontconfig — and linuxdeploy's own list is overruled by
  it. libxcb-cursor is the library both Qt images exist to carry: Qt 6.5 and
  newer link the xcb plugin against it, and RHEL 8 has it only in EPEL.

## The demos on Windows

Each is a folder, `plotcore-<toolkit>-demo`, that starts on a Windows with
nothing installed — the AppImage's claim, made by different means:

- **Qt:** `windeployqt` beside the executable, plus what it leaves out — the
  offscreen platform plugin, without which `--self-test` stops on a message
  box that nothing on a runner dismisses, and the Visual C++ runtime.
- **egui:** `+crt-static`, which the `cc` crate reads too and so compiles
  plotcore with `/MT`: one executable that needs nothing beside it. Release
  builds are a Windows-subsystem program, so no console opens beside it.
- **PyQt6:** PyInstaller, around the wheel CI tested and the same pins as the
  AppImage (`python/pyqt6-demo/requirements.txt`). `--collect-binaries
  plotcore` is what brings the C library, which no import names.

The runner has the Visual C++ redistributable installed, so a bundle that is
missing it still starts there. `verify.ps1` therefore reads every import in
the folder with `dumpbin` and fails on a runtime DLL the folder does not
carry, before it runs the self-test with Qt, Python and the toolchains off
the `PATH`.

## Conventions

- SPDX header on every file: `SPDX-FileCopyrightText: 2026 Jonas Sattler` (and
  `2026 Andreas Martin` beside it on files derived from his work in
  jonassattler/H5Scope#30) and `SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0-only`.
- `.clang-format` (LLVM base, 100 columns, 4 spaces) and `.clang-tidy` — match
  them. `cargo fmt` and `rustfmt.toml` for Rust.
- Doc comments are `///` on the declaration; `//` blocks above a decision
  explain *why*, and name the failure that prompted it when there was one.
  Never strip an existing comment to "clean up" — those paragraphs are
  load-bearing.
- Test names are sentences: `TEST_CASE("a spike on a bucket's last sample is
  drawn at that sample")`, `def test_the_golden_script_draws_the_c_digest()`.
- Assert behaviour in counts, not durations: a duration measures the machine, a
  count measures the program.
- Commit messages: a lower-case-ish imperative sentence as the subject, then a
  body that argues the change — what was observed, what was measured, what was
  decided against. Wrapped at ~72.

## Gotchas

- **Never ask a figure for a scene inside a closure that holds egui's
  context** — the text measure calls back into `ctx.fonts_mut`, which takes the
  same lock.
- The Rust toolchain is pinned in `rust/rust-toolchain.toml` (egui 0.37's
  minimum), so that CI and a reader's machine run the same clippy.
- A Qt target here says `AUTOMOC ON` itself. H5Scope turns it on for every
  target it builds, which is how the Qt example linked there and nowhere else
  until this repository built it alone.
- Headless Qt needs `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen`; every AppImage runs with
  `APPIMAGE_EXTRACT_AND_RUN=1` wherever there is no FUSE, CI included.
